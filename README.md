## Thank you for clicking on my portfolio repository!

It is currently being updated (see dev branch for more details.)

### Things to come:

Here are few things to expect in my portfolio:

```markdown
1. A dedicated section focusing on typography used for the resume templates I created during my internship.

2. A section or maybe just throughout the portfolio a demonstration of select animation created with css and javascript.

3. A section on projects with an anecdote/brief for each.
```
